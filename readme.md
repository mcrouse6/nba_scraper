# 2017-2018 ESPN NBA Fantasy Scaper

This is a quick, dirty hack for getting active rosters from a public ESPN NBA fantasy league. This is flimsy and will break but to install and run:

```bash
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.7 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scrape_util.py
```
